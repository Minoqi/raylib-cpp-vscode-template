# Raylib C++ vscode template (any platform)

The functionality of the raylib template was partially made by the gamedev.tv raylib course, with adjustments made.

# Adjustments

1. Added a main.cpp file with the barebone basics (initializing a white window screen)
2. Updated makefile so all code can be stored in the `src` folder and it'll update automatically
